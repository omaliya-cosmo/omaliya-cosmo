## üîß Required Setup

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONEPAY_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONEPAY_HASH_TOKEN=your_hash_token_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONEPAY_APP_TOKEN=your_app_token_here
```

### Database Migration

Run the following command to update your database schema:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

## üéØ How It Works

1. **User Flow**:

   - User selects "OnePay" payment method in checkout
   - Fills out form and clicks "Pay with OnePay"
   - OnePay payment popup/iframe opens
   - User completes payment
   - OnePay sends success/failure event
   - On success: Order is automatically created with transaction ID

2. **Payment Processing**:

   - OnePay payments are processed immediately
   - Orders are only created after successful payment
   - Transaction IDs are stored for reconciliation
   - Failed payments allow users to retry

3. **Event Handling**:
   - `onePaySuccess` event: Processes order creation
   - `onePayFail` event: Shows error and resets form

## üß™ Testing

1. Set up OnePay test credentials in `.env.local`
2. Use the `OnePayTest` component to test integration
3. Place test orders through the checkout flow
4. Verify transaction IDs are stored in database

## üìù Notes

- **Security**: OnePay handles all payment processing securely
- **Validation**: All form data is validated before payment initiation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all scenarios
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback during payment processing
- **Database**: Transaction IDs stored for audit trail

## üéâ Next Steps

1. Obtain OnePay merchant credentials
2. Update environment variables with real credentials
3. Test with OnePay sandbox environment
4. Deploy and test in production
5. Monitor payment flows and transaction logs
